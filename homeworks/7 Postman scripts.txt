You have generated shopitems express api.

1. Create Postman collection and requests to cover all endpoints (and code).
2. Create Postman tests/scripts to ensure the following for each request:
    2.1 Correct response status code is returned.
    2.2 The format of response is correct.
    3. Sometimes the error message returns, if it does ensure it is correct.
    It should be something like this:
        pm.expect(jsonData.error).to.eql("Expected error message here");

3. Create a github repo for this project, place your code and postman collection inside.

Collection example is in here:
