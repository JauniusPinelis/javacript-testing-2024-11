In the previous exercise you have covered 
https://sweetshop.netlify.app/ with functional tests
The aim of that exercise was to showcase ability to:
1. Analyse the web app.
2. Write test cases.
3. Move them to Jira and be able to track the progress.
4. Automate them using the cypress.
5. Setup Github repo with pipelines.

For the next homework the goal is very similar:
Please cover Bank app with functional e2e tests:
https://www.globalsqa.com/angularJs-protractor/BankingProject/

The details:
0. Please try using PLAYWRIGHT framework instead of cypress:
https://playwright.dev/
1. No need for Test Cases and Jira, this task is to recognise the test case and cover them using Playwright.
2. This is a portfolio project, so please setup public Github repo with readme and etc.
3. Try using Code generator, but the technology is defo not perfect, you will need to modify manually.
https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen
3. Once all tests are setup, please set up parallelism to run multiple tests at the same time:
