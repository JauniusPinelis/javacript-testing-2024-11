and covering it with cypress tests.

3. Generate a tic-tac-toe application for it:
Mention that you want the code in a single file.
Ask it to be for 2 players, makes it easier to practice.

5. Cover all the functionality in Tic-Tac-Toe with automated cypress tests.
6. Push everything to the repo and write the readme.md for this.
This will be your portfolio project.
