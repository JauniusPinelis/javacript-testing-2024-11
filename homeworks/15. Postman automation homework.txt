You have an application which allows you to register, login, and update user information:

1. Please covert all functionality with Postman requests and tests.
2. The tests should be runnable as a collection and they should be rerunnable.
3. The quality of tests matter:
You should be able to check if you can register account with specified email and passwords, 
and for that email the login should work. Think also in terms of scenarios.

This would be an portfolio project, so be detailed with this and spend some time.
Please create a separate github repo for this homework:
1. Create Github repo for this.
2. Copy the code from my repo into yours.
3. Export Postman collection to this.
